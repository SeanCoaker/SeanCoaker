# Hello, World! I'm Sean Coaker <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm a Swansea University student studying for an MEng in Software Engineering. I love all things programming and feel very grateful that one of my greatest hobbies will one day become my career. As well as programming, my hobbies include gaming, sport (football, cricket, Formula 1, golf), and PC building.

My obsessive attention to detail, competitiveness to be the best that I can be, and my desire to work on technologies that will better the lives of others and help to advance the human race, meant that Software Engineering was the perfect fit for me.
